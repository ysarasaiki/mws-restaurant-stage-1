### About the Project

For this project, a static website was converted to a mobile-ready web application, with accessibility features. The objective was to redesign the app as a responsive site for various display sizes and screen reader use. Features were also added to enable offline accessibility using Service Workers and caching.

### How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/ysarasaiki/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git` in terminal
2. `cd` into folder, and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

For example, using Python:

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
